"""
agents/patch_node.py — Patch-context reasoning node for the LangGraph sell-timing pipeline.

WHY THIS NODE EXISTS:
Price trends alone don't explain WHY something is moving — a rising price could be
due to a buff making the frame more desirable, or could be unrelated market noise.
This node adds semantic context: does a real game-balance change explain the trend,
or is the trend unexplained by anything in recent patches? This is real reasoning
work, not just data lookup — it's why an LLM is used here specifically, unlike
vault_node and trend_node which are pure code.

Most patchlog entries are irrelevant noise (cosmetic fixes, unrelated bug fixes for
other parts of the game bundled in the same patch). The LLM distinguishes signal
from noise, avoiding false positives where weak/cosmetic entries are stretched to
claim relevance.

could meaningfully impact market prices for "{frame_name}" components on Warframe Market.

FRAME: {frame_name}

RECENT PATCH ENTRIES (last {PATCHLOG_LOOKBACK_DAYS} days):
{patches_text}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Only consider content that is CLEARLY and SPECIFICALLY about {frame_name} itself —
   its abilities, stats, augments, or direct gameplay changes. Ignore entries that
   mention other Warframes, weapons, or general game systems unless they directly
   affect {frame_name}'s viability or desirability.

2. Classify whether any entry represents a MEANINGFUL game-balance change:
   - BUFF: Ability damage increased, survivability improved, augment added/improved,
     synergy with meta builds enhanced → would INCREASE demand/price
   - NERF: Ability effectiveness reduced, interaction removed, meta shift away →
     would DECREASE demand/price
   - REWORK: Major ability overhaul → impact is UNCLEAR until community reception settles
   - IRRELEVANT: Cosmetic fixes, unrelated bug fixes, text corrections, other items
     mentioned in the same patch → NO expected market impact

3. Be conservative: if a patch entry is ambiguous or only tangentially related to
   {frame_name}, classify it as irrelevant. False positives (claiming relevance that
   isn't there) are WORSE than saying "no relevant patch found."

4. If NO patch entries are provided, or none are relevant, respond with
   relevant_patch_found = false.

Respond with ONLY valid JSON (no markdown fences, no explanation outside the JSON):
{{
  "relevant_patch_found": true/false,
  "patch_name": "name of the relevant patch" or null,
  "expected_impact": "increase" or "decrease" or "unclear" or "none",
  "reasoning": "One-sentence plain-English justification for your judgment"
